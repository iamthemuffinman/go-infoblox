# go-infoblox
Go library for accessing the Infoblox API.

The general design and implementation (and some code) of this comes from the [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) library from Google.

## Can I help?
I love Pull Requests! I've linked above for how the general design of the library should work and [here](https://community.infoblox.com/t5/API-Integration/The-definitive-list-of-REST-examples/td-p/1214)
is some good info on the Infoblox API.
